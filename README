This is a very basic game of brick breaking. Bricks fallof randomly from the roof after fixed interval of time. Aim of the game is the collect bricks in the buckets corresponding to their colours. Also, there is a x-fixed y-movable cannon that can shoot down the falling bricks. A black brick should not fall in any of the buckets. This should end the game.  Buckets and cannon are movable by mouse as well as keyboard controls. 
Controls:
	‘A’ 	- 	rotate laser shooter up
	‘D’	-	rotate laser shooter down
	‘S’	-	move laser shooter down
	‘W’	-	move laser shooter up
	‘M’	-	increase speed
	‘N’	-	decrease bricks speed
	Arrow keys – adjust the viewing area when zoomed.
Mouse:
	click on the cannon to move it up or down
	click anywhere in the bricks falling area to aim that laser at that point.
Game Over Conditions:
	
	black brick falls on the bucket

press ‘r’ at any time to restart the game
press ‘q’ at any time to quit the game
whenever m or n is pressed ,new level (speed of bricks in printed)

To  change view options like
	-zoom, use mouse scroll / up or down arrows
	-pan, use left or right arrow keys / move mouse when right clicked .


Bonus:


A faint tone is played when there is an update in the score.
If laser hits the back of the mirror, it is not relfected , but absorbed.

 GLEW
 GLM

----------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
GLFW:
 - Install CMake
 - Obtain & Extract the GLFW source code from
   https://github.com/glfw/glfw/archive/master.zip
 - Compile with below commands
   $ cd glfw-master
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
   $ make && sudo make install

GLAD:
 - Go to http://glad.dav1d.de
 - Language: C/C++
   Specification: OpenGL
   gl: Version 4.5
   gles1: Version 1.0
   gles2: Version 3.2
   Profile: Core
   Select 'Add All' under extensions and click Generate.
 - Download the zip file generated.
 - Copy contents of include/ folder in the downloaded directory 
   to /usr/local/include/
 - src/glad.c should be always compiled along with your OpenGL 
   code

GLM:
 - Download the zip file from 
   https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.7.2
 - Unzip it and copy the folder glm/glm/ to /usr/local/include

Ubuntu users can also install these libraries using apt-get.
It is recommended to use GLFW+GLAD+GLM on all OSes.


FreeGLUT+GLEW+GLM can be used only on linux but not recommended.
Use apt-get to install FreeGLUT, libglew, glm on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------
Based on the your installation run the makefile in the GLFW or GLUT
If the system is linux then convert Makefile.linux to Makefile and run the make command

$mv Makefile.linux Makefile
$make
$./sample2D 

Similarly for mac
